# Site

This is my personal website where I document my journey as a developer.
Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the site is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to navigate. 

The site is hosted via **GitHub Pages** and regularly updated with new content and insights from my ongoing development experience.

## Running Locally

This application requires Node.js v18.17+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hgonzaga/site.git

cd site

npm install

npm run dev
```
